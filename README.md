# ZSH Theme by Grant Buster
Yet another zsh theme. This one plays well with WSL2. Based loosely on Fox and Jonathan themes from oh-my-zsh.
Big thanks to u/romkatv for [his post](https://www.reddit.com/r/zsh/comments/cgbm24/multiline_prompt_the_missing_ingredient/) on how to make nice multi-line zsh prompts

Includes git and conda integration, hostname and working directory info, and custom colors for different hosts. 

To install with oh-my-zsh:
```
git clone https://github.com/grantbuster/buster_zsh_theme.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/themes/buster_zsh_theme
```

And then in your .zshrc:
```
ZSH_THEME="buster_zsh_theme/buster"
```
