# ZSH Theme by Grant Buster
Yet another zsh theme. This one plays well with WSL2. Based loosely on Fox and Jonathan themes from oh-my-zsh.
Big thanks to u/romkatv for [his post](https://www.reddit.com/r/zsh/comments/cgbm24/multiline_prompt_the_missing_ingredient/) on how to make nice multi-line zsh prompts
